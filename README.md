# Terrain-Classification
Code for Transfer Training of ResNet50 Model on frames extracted from Dashcam videos

The Dataset can be downloaded from my google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19eHU0zznvNn4n8Wn1J2NKEaPu6WREDL9?usp=sharing

When running the code on a local machine, remove the code used to mount google drive in the uploaded python notebooks, download the dataset locally and change the paths accordingly.
